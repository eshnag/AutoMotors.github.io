  <h3>company history</h3> 
  <p id="history">Auto Motors was founded in 2004 by John Williams and Micheal Davis. They are based in San Francisco, California. They had recently graduated from M.I.T and wanted to create a more environmentally friendly vehicle for the public to use at an affordable price. They worked for years on designs of cars that not only was electric but also built for safety and could protect the passengers in drastic situations. Model E was released to a small audience in early 2016 and performed well; it was later released to the public to sell.<p/>
